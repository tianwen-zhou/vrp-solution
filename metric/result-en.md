### Explanation

1. **Small-scale Data (10-50 Stops)**:
   - **Total Distance**: The results for OR-Tools and RL are very close, with ACO slightly worse. ACO-RL hybrid slightly improves the total distance.
   - **Vehicles Used**: All algorithms use a similar number of vehicles (about 5).
   - **Computation Time**: OR-Tools is the fastest, while RL takes longer.
   - **Delivery Success Rate**: All algorithms achieve a high delivery success rate (>99%).
   - **Violation Rate**: OR-Tools has the lowest violation rate, while ACO and RL have slightly higher rates.

2. **Medium-scale Data (50-200 Stops)**:
   - **Total Distance**: ACO and RL show improvement in path optimization, but their longer computation time results in slightly worse total distance. The ACO-RL hybrid algorithm performs slightly better.
   - **Vehicles Used**: The number of vehicles used is consistent across all algorithms.
   - **Computation Time**: ACO-RL's computation time is longer, and RL also shows higher computation time.
   - **Delivery Success Rate**: All algorithms still maintain a high delivery success rate, with ACO-RL slightly outperforming.
   - **Violation Rate**: ACO-RL achieves the lowest violation rate.

3. **Large-scale Data (200+ Stops)**:
   - **Total Distance**: OR-Tools performs the best with the shortest total distance. ACO-RL hybrid performs better in terms of path optimization but at the cost of longer computation time.
   - **Vehicles Used**: ACO and RL use slightly more vehicles but are similar in vehicle usage.
   - **Computation Time**: OR-Tools remains the fastest, while RL and ACO-RL require significantly more time.
   - **Delivery Success Rate**: ACO-RL achieves a slightly higher success rate, approaching 100%.
   - **Violation Rate**: ACO-RL has the lowest violation rate, while OR-Tools has a slightly higher rate. ACO and RL have higher violation rates.

### Conclusion
- For **small-scale data**, the performance differences between algorithms are small. OR-Tools remains slightly superior.
- For **medium-scale data**, ACO-RL hybrid shows advantages in path optimization, but at the cost of higher computation time.
- For **large-scale data**, OR-Tools is the most efficient, especially in terms of computation time. However, ACO-RL outperforms in terms of path quality and delivery success rate.

These simulated results are based on the known characteristics of the algorithms and their typical performance on VRP problems. Actual results may vary depending on the specific implementation and parameter tuning.
